## Shortcuts View
The shorcuts view is the main view of Clipboard++. 
![ShortcutsView](./images/en-US/ShortCutsView.png)

**If closed it can be opened pressing Win+Alt+V**

### Searching for contents
We have 2 different ways of searching content
#### Manual search
As we saw Clipboard is the selected cell and by using the **up and down keys** on your keyboard we can select other cells.

![SelectedCell](./images/en-US/Move.gif)

There are some visual guides to show if there are more cells below or above:

![CellsBelow](./images/en-US/CellsBelow.png)

![CellsAbove](./images/en-US/CellsAbove.png)

#### Text search
The second method is by using the search text on top.
This can be accesed via a click or via a tab. After that introduce the text that might contain some cells:
![Search](./images/en-US/Search.gif)

If you have many results you can also move up or down to reach the desired cell.

### Load and Paste
Both methods follow the same process:
 1. Focus the window where you want to copy or paste text
 2. Open the shortcuts window. Easiest way is Win+Alt+V but there are others [Opening back](#opening-back)
 3. Select your option
Copy:

Paste:

### Using shortucts
Every cell has a defined load and a defined paste shorcut as seing in [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)
Pressing the correct shortcut will have the same effect as it corresponding [Load or Paste button](#load-and-paste)
If a shortcut is not working:
  1. Check the search doesnt have the focus, press Esc to free the focus.
  2. Check that your shortcuts follow the [Good practices](#good-practices)

## Expanded View
To access the expanded view of Clipboard++ just click the Expand button on shortcuts view (Insertar gif haciendolo)


**In this window no shorcuts can be done**

### Cell managment
For changing the selected cell we know have access to some buttons (gif haciendolo)

#### Modifying content
We can modify the contents of a memory cell by loading some text through the text input or by clearing the existant text. (gif haciendo ambos)

#### Modifying clipboard
We can also load any text form any of the memory cells to the clipboard with the load to clipboard button (gif)

#### Shortcuts

Shortcuts is the most important aspect to reach the desired speed. We can always see the shortcuts of a selected cell and edit them.
For editing a shortcut:
  1. Press the correct edit button
  2. Press the desired shorcut
  3. Confirm

##### Good practices

For a better experience using Clipboard++ it is recommended to use this pattern for shortcuts: 
  - Any key + C for copying
  - Any key + V for pasting

Shorcuts mustn't be duplicated. If that happens Clipboard++ will do nothing as it cannot select just one.

Lastly, if you have the following shortcuts:
  - T + B
  - T + B + C
Clipboard++ wont ever detect the T + B shortcut as there is another one with the same structure

## Import and Export files
Import and export process is practically the same:
  1. Click the Import or Export button
  2. Select a file
  3. Introduce a delimiter. No program can 100% detect the delimiter of a file so please use one that is not present in the text of the file provided.
  4. Confirm

## Autocopy
The autocopy functionality listnes to any changes in the clipboard and moves **ALL** memory cells contens one down. This means that the contents of memory cell 20 will be lost when the clipboard contents changes. So use at your own risk.

## Opening back

There are mainly 2 options:
  1. Using Win + Alt + V
  2. Through the system tray icon (Insert gif)

Any other way might make that the [Shortcuts View](#shortcuts-view) doesn't work as expected

## Quitting

For quitting Clipboard++ it is not enough to close the window.
You will need to use the Quit option on the system tray icon. (gif haciendolo)
